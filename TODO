Brainstorm of new features and code ideas, in no particular order:

- Improve default config.ini

- Write last game, theme, fullscreen and window size to config.ini, preserving comments

- Finish Exapunks: completed face cards stacks must be face down and immovable

- Drop PyXDG for a platform-independent alternative, such as appdirs or similar

- Revert from pyproject.toml to setup.cfg to lower setuptools requirement back to Python 3.6

- Use setuptools to install desktop integration. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/44462146/624066

- Create a debian/ dir, `.deb` packaging script and a PPA

- Upload to PyPi!

- Use more PyGame 2 features:
    - Freetype fonts
    - display / fullscreen switch improvements

- Use Calendar Versioning. v1.0 was just to indicate first public release. v20YY-MM from now on

- Use more Python 3 features:
  - Enums (3.4)
  - Annotations for Type Hints (3.0), possibly using `typing` module (3.5)
  - Formatted string literals, as in f"{name!r}" (3.6)
  - Dataclasses (3.7)

- Android support: use PNG instead of SVG for Slot and Theme

- "blue mask" highlight when dragging card over a droppable area, possibly changing cursor to crosshair (see Aisleriot)

- Integrate cards.Slot with graphics.Slot

- Instructions splash

- Concept idea: cards are *always* in a slot. Can make GUI/gamerules API a LOT simpler if all operations are done
  with slot as argument, cards being an additional argument. No more "get_top_item()" insanity!
  (or "if card in self.slots", for that matter). OTOH, cards library will lose a lot of freedom:
  drop will always be on a slot, somewhat forcing card drop to tail

- Allow drop on tail when card collide with any card of stack (highlight the tail). Will perhaps require either
  stack/slot.rect = rect.union(*card.rect) or the "all cards have a slot" model

- Idea for Enum: metaclass special *value* NONE (==None). Any member with this value is excluded from iterations.
  Enums define their own NONE *member*, if they want to, as NONE = Enum.NONE

- Background mode: create a MODE Enum, values AUTO, FILLCOLOR, TILE, SCALE, ORIGINAL
	FILLCOLOR = ignores file and use solid color fill
	TILE = repeats the image horizontally and vertically
	SCALE = resizes the image to fit the window
	ORIGINAL = just blit the original image at (0, 0).
	CENTER = same as ORIGINAL, but centered
	AUTO = SCALE if file is at least (800, 600), TILE otherwise

	center and original also fill the background first
	all file-based modes fallback to FILLCOLOR if file is not found

- Background, Theme and Slot should handle both vector and non-vector images, and deal appropriately (original/render)

- TAB to load next theme. Show off, I know :)

- Deck.set_theme should trigger resize() if cardsize is not the same. That would require storing maxcardsize I guess
	But if IS the same, blit on self.surface instead of re-assigning it

- create installers: .desktop, shell script, setuptools setup.py, debian/ dir, PPA
  For setup.py: entry_points = {'gui_scripts': ['pylitaire = pylitaire.main:main']

- Change iconset due to conflicting licensing

- Config file sections suggestion:
  (maybe leave all in a big [options] or [pylitaire] section)
	[background]
	basename (no extension. 'baize' in g)
	fillcolor (fillcolor. BGCOLOR in g)
	mode

	[theme]
	name (no extension, must be svg)

	[slot]
	basename

	[graphics]
	fullscreen (boolean)
	fullscreen_resolution (tuple, empty for desktop)

	[game]
	gamename
	game options?

- Make cards / themes a self-contained library. Not sure how to deal with enums (also used by ui).
  graphics will need to be slipt: svg-support function goes to library, game-specific functions and classes stay

- create menu+info (at right side, a la arkanoid, or perhaps as button bar on top)
  gui module controls them, widgets register callbacks for certain events

- double-click on foundation (slot or card) bring all possible cards

- High scores and times, and winning ratios. Per-game.

- use custom exceptions to signal events from UI to Main loop/render: Quit, ClearScreen, etc.
  the ones who were formerly boolean flags such as done, clear

- "No more moves" detection

- Font list/loader for a better-looking font. Arial perhaps?

- Be smarter about click and drag: drop targets should not include current slot/parent ("own drop" should be considered
  a drag abort), and a (successful) drop should abort click (and perhaps doubleclick too).

- Keep an eye on possible replacements for LibRsvg to be more pip-friendly: cairosvg, wand, PySDL2, etc

Known bugs and glitches:

- "background strip" in cards when increasing window size, as a consequence of status bar moving down
  Can be fixed by either:
	- making all cards always dirty. 1-line fix (Deck to LayeredUpdate instead of LayeredDirty),
	  but huge impact on CPU usage, as expected
	- Make cards + widgets a single Group, and use it for drawing. Easy, but cards should now use
	  *that* group when Group.move_to_top(), in a way that is still decoupled from GUI. Perhaps
	  if self.groups: self.groups[-1].move_to_top(). All widgets must added at another layer

- widget sprite group should go back to LayeredDirty, to be less taxing on CPU.

- Win animation has some flaws, fixing would perhaps require its own custom event/update/draw loop:
	- Last card movement is not drawn, since win condition is checked on update() which runs before draw()
	- Also affects score not updating after final move
	- Animated bouncing is drawn behind still cards

- Improve window resizing, possibly using https://github.com/pygame/pygame/issues/1624#issuecomment-610604718
