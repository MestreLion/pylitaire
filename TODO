Brainstorm of new features and code ideas
Loosely ordered from "hanging fruits easy to do" to "deep stuff"

- "blue mask" highlight when dragging card over a droppable area

- Slots should perhaps be special cards handled by Deck: they resize the same, also need collision detection
  with cards, have a highlight, etc

- Background mode: create a MODE Enum, values AUTO, FILLCOLOR, TILE, SCALE, ORIGINAL
	FILLCOLOR = ignores file and use solid color fill
	TILE = repeats the image horizontally and vertically
	SCALE = resizes the image to fit the window
	ORIGINAL = just blit the original image at (0, 0).
	CENTER = same as ORIGINAL, but centered
	AUTO = SCALE if file is at least (800, 600), TILE otherwise

	center and original also fill the background first
	all file-based modes fallback to FILLCOLOR if file is not found

- TAB to load next theme. Show off, I know :)

- Resize
	main loop triggers graphics.resize(size, *objects). objects = initially, deck instances only
	graphics.resize() do:
		new playarea and card sizes
		g.window resize
		g.background.resize()
		g.slot resize
		all known elements (menu, etc)
		for each object, object.resize()
	Deck.resize() - re-render svg and update each card rect

- Config file
	have a template at data/, use  it for factory defaults, copy to CONFIGDIR if not there
	window_size should be a separate file, so INI is never written (preserve comments)

	[background]
	basename (no extension. 'baize' in g)
	fillcolor (fillcolor. BGCOLOR in g)
	mode

	[theme]
	name (no extension, must be svg)

	[slot]
	basename

	[graphics]
	fullscreen (boolean)
	fullscreen_resolution (tuple, empty for desktop)

- Find a way to set all modules logging level without messing with root logger if main was imported

- Playarea. 4x3 ratio, the rest is GUI: statusbar (bottom), menu+info (at right side, a la arkanoid)

- gui module, controls the above elements, also receives and dispatches events. maybe also a simple
  singleton class EventHandler/Dispatcher where generic objects (deck, buttons, etc) register callbacks
  for certain events

- Game module, handles all logic. receives events from main loop (or gui module), keeps game state

- Keep track of cards movements, and BACKSPACE to undo

- Cards "falling/bouncing" when win, a la Windows 3.1 Solitaire

- Rename the project to Pyukon Solitaire

- Make a working game :)
