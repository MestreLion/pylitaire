Gnome Baize (Background)
------------------------

From Gnome Games' Aisleriot package, version 3.6.2.

This was the last version of Aisleriot containing the the original, green baize
before it was replaced by a gray-ish white noise texture from a different artist.
Original artist is unknown, so here I credited the commit author that first
added the original file to Aisleriot's repository in 1998-09-06

Gnome Slot
----------

Also from Aisleriot.

Made by Richard Hoelscher, the SVG was first commited in 2004-11-10 and never
changed since then. It looks similar to a XPM version published in 1998 by
Jonathan Blandford. I am not sure if the SVG is derived work or not (it's a
simple card slot!), so I'm crediting Richard.
